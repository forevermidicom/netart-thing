netart thing is an interactive digital artwork made mainly in HTML and JavaScript that explores the unpredictable nature of collaboration between human and machine. Conceived through a process of “vibe coding”, this project is a fluid conversation with non-human intelligences, where intentionality is expressed through a sensory and intuitive connection to the code. netart thing is released under a Creative Commons 1.0 Universal License, inviting others to build upon this experiment.
